# Velvet Vial Keyboard Configuration

This repository contains my personal keyboard configuration for QMK-compatible keyboards using the [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) firmware.

This configuration is for a split keyboard layout with multiple layers:
- **Layer 0**: Base layer with QWERTY layout and home row mods
- **Layer 1**: Numbers and navigation
- **Layer 2**: Symbols and arrows
- **Layer 3**: Function keys, media controls, and system shortcuts

## Features

- Home row mods (GACS - GUI, ALT, CTRL, SHIFT)

2. Open the Vial application
3. Connect your Vial-compatible keyboard
4. Go to File â†’ Load Saved Layout
